## User Stories

### Roles

Two roles, owner of the shop (Owner), and Customer.

### Owner

* Selling Bicycles Online
As Owner,
I want to sell bicycles online through a website,
So that I can grow my business and reach more customers.

* Expand to Other Products
As Owner,
I want the website to be flexible enough to sell other sports-related items in the future (e.g., skis, surfboards, roller skates),
So that I can expand my product range as my business grows.

* Out of Stock Management
As Owner,
I want to mark certain part variations as "temporarily out of stock",
So that customers cannot order items that I cannot fulfill.

* Dynamic Price Adjustments
As Owner,
I want to apply dynamic pricing rules where certain part prices depend on other part selections (e.g., matte finish costs more on full suspension),
So that I don't lose money on customized bicycle orders.

* Admin: Manage Products
As Owner,
I want to create new products (e.g., new bicycle models or other sports-related items),
So that I can update my store's offerings.

* Admin: Manage Parts and Variations
As Owner,
I want to add or remove part choices (e.g., add new rim colors or remove discontinued ones),
So that I can keep my product catalog up-to-date.

* Admin: Update Pricing
As Owner,
I want to change prices for individual parts and configure special price rules for combinations (e.g., specific frame and finish combinations),
So that I can maintain flexible pricing for my products

### Customer

* Customizing Bicycles
As Customer,
I want to customize my bicycle by selecting different options for parts (e.g., frame type, wheel type, rim color, chain),
So that I can create a bicycle that fits my personal preferences and needs.

* Prohibited Combinations
As Customer,
I want to see which part combinations are not available based on my selections (e.g., mountain wheels only available with full suspension frames),
So that I avoid selecting incompatible bicycle parts.

* Viewing Available Options
As Customer,
I want to view available part options and prices for a specific bicycle model on the product page,
So that I can make informed decisions about my customization.

* Add Customized Bicycle to Cart
As Customer,
I want to add my customized bicycle to the shopping cart,
So that I can proceed to checkout and complete my purchase.

* Price Calculation for Bicycles
As Customer,
